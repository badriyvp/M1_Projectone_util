I am doing utility code or a small project(code ) for a scoreboard of cricket board 
how it workes:
1) if you enter a score like runs and wickets then if it matches to a particular person, then that player name will be shown on the console
2) Here if a player score runs like a 100 or more then the console will show it as century
3) And if a person took more wickets like 5 or more then it will show five wickes

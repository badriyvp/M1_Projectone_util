design
In this file i added design 
structural and behavioural diagrams
I am doing utility code or a small project(code ) for a scoreboard of cricket board 
how it workes:
1) if you enter a score like runs and wickets then if it matches to a particular person, then that player name will be shown on the console
2) Here if a player score runs like a 100 or more then the console will show it as century
3) And if a person took more wickets like 5 or more then it will show five wickes


4Ws and 1H:
WHAT: This project(code) is all about a cricket match in which a scoreboard is represented(partial scoreboard)

WHY: It is very useful while match is running and it will tell about scores and preformence of the team and also about a particular person

WHERE: Where it used is in a cricket match

WHEN: During a match

HOW:  WITH THE HELP OF THE PARTICULAR SCORE IT WILL TELL IS IT BEST OR WORSE
